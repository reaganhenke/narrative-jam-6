      Ghost Whisperer is brought to you by the marvelous Joss!
      FalseTrout (sound), IfThenCreate (tech), LaChapeliere (writing) and NightSparrow
      (visual) make it work behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>Equipped with her trusted ghost interpreter, Joss travels across the country
      to hear what ghosts have on their minds and assist in settling their unfinished business.
      So if you have a ghost you'd like helped into the other side, give us a call!</p>
    <p>
      These are exciting times for Joss, as she's just been contacted by a big company
      who wants to sponsor her show! Over the next month, she needs to rack up as many
      viewers as possible in order to impress them. She'll have to up her game, because
      we all know that the BooTube crowd isn't a forgiving one...
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a tricky balance to find: people want drama, drama, drama, until suddenly
      they think you sound fake. And sometimes, the ghosts' requests are just so boring…
      So if Joss plays fast and loose with her interpretation, no one has to know, right?
      Especially not that sucker from Spectral Self-Help who's also sniffing around
      trying to find something to bring Ghost Whisperer down...
    </p>
    <P>
      Anyway, time to meet some ghosts!
    </p>
